            <h2>Summary on The Twelve Pillars</h2>
            <h3>by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener</h3>
            <p>The book, Twelve Pillars by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener is a very interesting read to young or aspiring minds who crave success. The book highlights the factors that would be needed for personal development and financial development.<br>
                The main idea of the book is to get readers informed about the changes they need to make in their lives in order to be successful. Without that significant change, their success in life will be at a hault.<br>
                The book focus of different factors to success which is highlighted in each chapter. Chapter 4 of the book entitled " The major reason for setting a goal is for what makes of you to accomplish it", describes a old timer named Charlie teaching career stagnant Michael about making goals.<br>
                The book suggest that it is imperitive for someone who desires to be successful to write their goals, both micro-goals and long term goals. In this way, the brain will cognitively operate on ways to achieve those written goals.<br>
                However in chapter 6 entitled, "Surround Yourself With the Best People", suggests that it is highly unlikely to be successful with the wrong people around you to take you to the next level in life. The old timer Charlie implied that a reason why Michael wasn't as successful was that he had the wrong people around him.<br>
                He indicated suggestions that his friends didn't have the right attitude to be sucessful and needed to choose whether to limit his association or disassociation in order to be motivated enough to aquire them. He also implied that Michael need to hang with the more successful people in order to be motivated and self-driven <br>
                to also pursue his goals. In chapter 7 "Be a Life-Long Learner", Charlie pointed out to Michael that a formal education was great however it doesn't actually teach you how to be successful. Charline insinuated that Michael need to learn tings on his own(self education)<br> 
                to be able to acquire more knowledge that he could use to grow throughout his life through continuous reading. Through reading, he would be able to cognitively mature and comprehend any form of issues he faced.

             <h2>How could this apply to me?</h2>
             <p>
                With all honest, I've already been applying some of Charlie's teachings in my life. Throughtout my high school tenure, I encountered a rough path where I got involved with the wrong set of people.<br>
                In order to change the direction of my life, I was encouraged by a similar person as Charlie who councilled me in becoming something of value. The changes I first made was to disassociate myseld <br>
                with the people who wanted nothing out of life and associate myself with the ones who wanted to achieve and make their parents proud. In doing so, I can say I've achieve so much more than I ever anticipated. I ultimaely believe that<br>
                once I make a goal, it is importantto make a note of it because it drives you in the direction of achieving it. However, I think being a life long-learner could be extremely benecially to me in staying focus on pursuing my major.<br>
                My desired major which is computer science, is a field of study that requires a complete committment in acquiring knowledge as the techology industry is constantly evoloving.

            <h2>My Development Journey</h2>
            <p>
                Over the past few years, I have grown both personally and professionally. My journey has been marked by self-discovery, learning new skills, and facing challenges head-on. One of the major areas of focus has been improving my technical skills in computing, and I have consistently strived to push my boundaries in this field.<br>
                There skills I've learnt so far on my journey as a computing student is the ability to visualize solutions and approach I want to take to problems I face on a daily or occasional basis. <br>
                Another skilled I picked up, though many people may see it as merely a trait is 'Patience'. I believe as a computing student or any technical personnel, it's very important<br>
                to have the ability to be patient. Patience can be beneficial in which 
            </p>
            <p>
                Personal development, for me, is a continuous process. I have embraced the mindset of lifelong learning and constantly seek opportunities to grow.
